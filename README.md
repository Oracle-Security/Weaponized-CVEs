# Weaponized-CVEs
A collection of CVE's to that are weaponized to exploit whatever PoC it is exploiting. Such as automatically dropping beacons and shells. 

All Scripts can be used with OracleMassAttackFramework for ease of attacking multiple targets.

Additionally, all scripts have original PoC Creators, Links, and other resources for the code that was used. I do not claim to have coded any of these scripts from scratch.
